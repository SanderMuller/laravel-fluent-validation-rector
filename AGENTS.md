## Performance benchmarks

This package's rules run per-AST-node during Rector traversal, so the hot path is
the rule pipeline in `src/Rector/` — and the fast-path rule-string cache in
`src/Rector/Concerns/ConvertsValidationRuleStrings.php`.

Performance work goes through the **autoresearch** loop, not a Pest group. The
benchmark scripts live in `autoresearch/` and run this package's rules against a
synthetic consumer corpus, measuring wall-clock via `hrtime()`:

```bash
php autoresearch/rule-pipeline-bench.php   # whole-pipeline wall-clock
php autoresearch/per-rule-profile.php      # per-rule breakdown
```

Benchmark when touching the rule pipeline or its caches: capture a baseline,
make one change, re-run, and keep it only if the metric improves. The
`autoresearch` skill drives the full measure → change → keep-or-revert loop —
activate it for any sustained optimization work.

## Public API discipline

The package's public API surface is enumerated in `PUBLIC_API.md` at the repo
root. Every symbol listed there is governed by SemVer 2.0 — renames or
signature changes require a MAJOR bump. Symbols not listed are `@internal`
and may change in any release.

### When adding a public symbol

A class is public when it lives under `src/` outside the
`SanderMuller\FluentValidationRector\Internal\` namespace AND lacks an
`@internal` PHPDoc tag. If you add a class, public method, or public
constant matching this shape, **update `PUBLIC_API.md` in the same
commit**:

- Add the FQN under the appropriate section heading (Set list constants,
  Rector class FQNs, Rector configuration constants, etc.).
- If introducing a new section, add it to the existing structure rather
  than creating a parallel doc.
- Update `tests/InternalAuditTest::PUBLIC_CLASSES` so the namespace audit
  test recognizes the new symbol as intentionally public (otherwise it
  fires "missing @internal tag" on the next test run).

If the symbol is internal — anything intended as implementation detail
that consumers should NOT import — place it under
`src/Internal/` (namespace `SanderMuller\FluentValidationRector\Internal\`).
The namespace IS the structural commitment; the `@internal` PHPDoc tag is
optional inside that namespace.

### When deleting or renaming a public symbol

Direct removal of a public symbol is a MAJOR-bump-only event. For pre-MAJOR
releases:

- **Add a deprecation cycle.** Keep the old name as a `class_alias` (for
  classes) or method-level `@deprecated` PHPDoc tag (for methods),
  pointing at the new name.
- **Document the cycle in `PUBLIC_API.md`** — note when the deprecation
  shipped and when the removal is slated. Example: 0.20.0's `Diagnostics` /
  `RunSummary` namespace move added shims at the old location with
  `@deprecated since 0.20.0 — removal slated for 1.0`; the shims were
  removed in 0.22.0 (the 1.0 RC scope-lock release).
- **Mention it in the release notes** under a "Deprecations" section so
  consumers see the timeline.

### `Internal\` namespace as a do-not-import signal

Classes under `SanderMuller\FluentValidationRector\Internal\` are
implementation detail. They are NOT part of the public API:

- Their existence, signatures, and behavior may change in any release.
- Downstream consumers importing them are doing so against the
  documentation — breakage is on them.
- The namespace placement is the do-not-import signal. The PHPDoc
  `@internal` tag is optional but harmless inside `Internal\`.

When designing a new helper, default to `Internal\`. Only place a class
in the public namespace root or `Set\`/`Config\`/`Config\Shared\` when
it's an intentional consumer-facing surface.

### When in doubt

Default to `@internal`. Promoting a class from internal to public later is
a non-event (just add the `PUBLIC_API.md` entry); demoting a public class
back to internal requires a deprecation cycle and a MAJOR bump. The
asymmetric cost makes "internal until proven otherwise" the safe default.

## Release Notes vs CHANGELOG

`CHANGELOG.md` is **auto-populated by CI** on release. Do not hand-edit it.

When you need to document a user-facing change for a release, write it to `RELEASE_NOTES_<version>.md` at the repo root (already gitignored via the `RELEASE_NOTES*.md` pattern). The CI release job picks it up and promotes it into `CHANGELOG.md` as part of the tag flow.

If you find yourself editing `CHANGELOG.md` directly, stop — it will be overwritten.

## Fixing PHPStan Errors

When fixing a PHPStan error, first decide whether it represents a runtime bug a test could catch — and if so, write that test before the fix.

### Process

1. **Assess testability** — does the error represent a runtime bug a test could reproduce (a wrong argument type, a missing method, an incorrect return type used downstream)?
2. **Write the test first** — if a test can catch it, write a failing test that reproduces the error before applying the fix.
3. **Fix the code** — apply the fix so both the PHPStan error and the new test pass.
4. **Verify both** — confirm PHPStan reports no error and the test passes.

### When to Write a Test

Write a test when the PHPStan error indicates a fault that would surface at runtime:

- A method call on a value of the wrong type
- Missing or incorrect arguments to a function or method
- A return-type mismatch that would break callers
- Accessing a property or method that does not exist
- Any type error that would manifest as a runtime exception

### When to Skip the Test

Skip the test when the error is purely static and cannot cause a runtime failure:

- Missing return-type declarations
- PHPDoc mismatches with no runtime impact
- Unused variables or imports
- Generic-type parameter issues

---

## Signed Commits

Applies **only when the repository has commit signing enabled** (e.g. `git config commit.gpgsign` is `true`, or a `user.signingkey` / `gpg.format` is set). If signing is not enabled, this guideline does not apply — commit normally.

### Never fall back to an unsigned commit

When signing is enabled, every commit must be signed. If the signing backend or agent (1Password, `gpg-agent`, `ssh-agent`, a hardware key, etc.) is unavailable, locked, or not responding:

- **Stop and surface the failure** to the user with the exact error.
- **Do not** retry with `--no-gpg-sign`, unset `commit.gpgsign`, or otherwise produce an unsigned commit to "get past" the problem.

A missing signature is a blocker to resolve (unlock the agent, re-authenticate 1Password, plug in the key), not a step to skip. Let the user fix the signing setup, then commit signed.

## Verification Before Completion

Before claiming any work is complete or successful, run the verification command fresh and confirm the output. Evidence before claims, always.

### Required Before Any Completion Claim

1. **Run** the relevant command (in the current message, not from memory)
2. **Read** the full output
3. **Confirm** it supports the claim
4. **Then** state the result with evidence

| Claim            | Required verification                                            |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tests pass       | The project's test command, output showing 0 failures            |
| Code style clean | The project's formatter/style checker, output showing no changes |
| Linting clean    | The project's linter, output showing 0 errors                    |
| Types check      | The project's type checker, output showing 0 errors              |
| Bug fixed        | The previously failing test now passes                           |
| Feature complete | All related tests pass                                           |

Use the project's own commands — check its `composer.json` / `package.json` scripts, CI config, or sibling docs to find them. Do not assume a specific tool.

### Delegating the checks

Where the project has dedicated quality-check skills synced, delegate to them — `backend-quality` for backend files, `frontend-quality` for frontend files, both when a change spans both. Otherwise, run the project's own equivalent commands directly.

### Never Use Without Evidence

- "should work now"
- "that should fix it"
- "looks correct"
- "I'm confident this works"

These phrases indicate missing verification. Run the command first, then report what actually happened.

## FluentRule Validation

- This project uses `sandermuller/laravel-fluent-validation` for type-safe validation rules. Use `FluentRule::` instead of string rules or `Rule::` where possible.
- FormRequests MUST use `HasFluentRules` trait. Livewire components MUST use `HasFluentValidation` trait.
- Do NOT use `->rule('string_rule')` when a native FluentRule method exists. Check the skill references before using escape hatches.
- Available types: `FluentRule::string()`, `integer()`, `numeric()`, `email()`, `date()`, `dateTime()`, `boolean()`, `array()`, `file()`, `image()`, `password()`, `field()`.
- Convenience shortcuts: `FluentRule::url()`, `uuid()`, `ulid()`, `ip()` — shorthand for `FluentRule::string()->url()`, etc.
- `email()` and `password()` use app defaults (`Email::default()`, `Password::default()`). Pass `defaults: false` to opt out.
- All conditional modifiers (`requiredIf`, `excludeIf`, `prohibitedIf`, etc.) accept both `(string $field, ...$values)` AND `(Closure|bool)` — do NOT wrap in `Rule::requiredIf()`.
- For converting validation rules, activate the `fluent-validation-optimize` skill which has a complete method reference.
- For Livewire-specific guidance, activate the `fluent-validation-livewire` skill.

# Package Boost Guidelines

These guidelines replace Laravel Boost's default foundation for
repositories that ship as Composer packages — Laravel-targeted or
framework-agnostic. The framing, tooling, and trade-offs differ from
application development; follow this version when working inside a
package codebase.

## Foundational Context

This codebase is a **Composer package**, not an application. The rules
below hold regardless of which framework (if any) the package targets.

- There is no `app/`, `bootstrap/`, `routes/`, `.env`, or database by
  default. Tooling that assumes an application context (e.g. running
  `php artisan` against the package itself) does not apply.
- The primary artefact is the package's public API — entry-point
  classes, service providers, exposed contracts. Everything else is
  scaffolding.
- Downstream consumers depend on this package via Composer. Every
  public change is a user-facing API change governed by semver.
- `composer.json` is the source of truth for supported PHP versions
  and any framework constraints. Check `require.php` (and any
  `require.<framework>/*` entries) before using version-specific
  features.

## Source Layout

- `src/` — package source, PSR-4 autoloaded per `composer.json`
- `tests/` — Pest or PHPUnit suite
- `config/` — publishable defaults shipped with the package, when
  applicable
- `resources/` — views, translations, Boost skills / guidelines, when
  applicable
- `database/migrations`, `database/factories` — only if the package
  ships them
- `workbench/` — developer-only Testbench scaffolding when Testbench
  is in use; never shipped

Check sibling files before inventing structure. Do not introduce new
top-level directories without a clear reason.

## Tests Are the Specification

The package has no running application to click through. Tests are how
behaviour is pinned down.

- Write tests alongside any behavioural change.
- Do not create "verification scripts" when a test can prove the same
  thing.
- Run the project's configured test runner (`vendor/bin/pest` or
  `vendor/bin/phpunit`) before claiming a change is done.

## Public API Discipline

- Every `public`, `protected`, or exported symbol is part of the
  package's surface. Breaking changes require a major version bump.
- Prefer `final` classes and `private`/`@internal` markers for
  anything not intended for extension.
- Keep config keys, published asset paths, and service container
  bindings stable across patch and minor versions.

## Conventions

- Match existing code style, naming, and structural patterns — check
  sibling files before writing new ones.
- Use descriptive names (`resolvePublishDestination`, not `resolve()`).
- Reuse existing helpers before adding new ones.
- Do not add dependencies without approval; every new `require` is a
  constraint downstream consumers inherit.

## Extending boost-core

If your package authors a custom `FileEmitter` (to write a file like
`.mcp.json` into the host during `boost sync`), declare the
`boost-extension` tag in your `boost.php` `withTags([...])`. That pulls
the `writing-file-emitter` skill — gated off by default so consumers
who do not extend the engine don't carry it, which is why an
emitter-authoring package has to opt in explicitly. The same tag pulls
`skill-authoring` for writing boost-family skills.

## Documentation Files

Only create or edit documentation (README, CHANGELOG, docs/) when
explicitly requested or when a behaviour change requires it.

## Replies

Be concise. Focus on what changed and why. Skip restating what the
diff already shows.

---

# Release Automation

Conventions the package-boost family shares for release flow. The
procedural detail lives in the `pre-release` and `release-notes`
skills — loaded on-demand, not pinned here.

## CHANGELOG is CI-managed

`.github/workflows/update-changelog.yml` prepends the release body to
`CHANGELOG.md` on `release: released` and commits to the release's
target branch (typically `main`). Don't hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md` as
part of a release. Post-release typo fixes are committed directly.

## Release notes live in `internal/release-notes-<version>.md`

`internal/` is gitignored — drafts stay local. The notes file becomes
the release body. The first line pins the green commit so the pre-tag
gate can fail closed on drift:

```
<!-- verified-sha: <full sha> -->
```

## Tag and title

- Tag: bare version (`0.7.0`) — Composer and Packagist read the tag.
- Release title: `v`-prefixed (`v0.7.0`) — cosmetic.
- Notes file: bare (`internal/release-notes-0.7.0.md`).

## Agent handoff

Agents stop at the ready-to-tag handoff. The user runs the pre-tag
gate and publishes the release (GitHub UI, `gh`, or otherwise). See
the `pre-release` skill for the full procedure and the no-release-create
rule.
