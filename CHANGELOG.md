# Changelog

All notable changes to `sandermuller/laravel-fluent-validation-rector` will be documented in this file.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- `GroupWildcardRulesToEachRector` no longer injects `->nullable()` on a synthesized parent. Before, a rules array like `'keys.p256dh' => ...->required(), 'keys.auth' => ...->required()` was rewritten to `'keys' => FluentRule::array()->nullable()->children([...])`, which silently accepted payloads without `keys` at all — the `nullable()` short-circuited evaluation so the nested `required()` children never fired. The synthesized parent is now bare (`FluentRule::array()->children([...])`), restoring the original dot-notation semantics where missing `keys` triggers the nested `required` rules. Reported by a peer running 0.1.0 against the collectiq codebase.
- `children()` and `each()` arrays are now always printed one-key-per-line. Before, synthesized nested arrays collapsed onto a single line, producing 200+ character entries when child values contained further arrays (e.g. `->in([...])`) that Pint couldn't reflow. Multi-line printing is now forced via Rector's `NEWLINED_ARRAY_PRINT` attribute regardless of child complexity.
- `AddHasFluentRulesTraitRector` and `AddHasFluentValidationTraitRector` now emit a proper top-of-file `use` import for the trait and reference the short name inside the class body. Before, the rule emitted `use \SanderMuller\FluentValidation\HasFluentRules;` inline, relying on the consumer's `rector.php` to enable `withImportNames()` (or on Pint) to clean it up. The rule now queues the import via Rector's `UseNodesToAddCollector` directly, so out-of-the-box output is polished regardless of downstream formatter configuration.
- `AddHasFluentRulesTraitRector` and `AddHasFluentValidationTraitRector` now emit a blank line between the inserted trait and the next class member. Before, Livewire components whose first member was a docblocked property (`/** @var ... */\npublic array $foo = ...;`) had the trait glued directly to the docblock without separation. Pint doesn't rescue this unless the consumer opts into `class_attributes_separation.trait_import`, so the rule inserts a `Nop` statement to produce the blank line itself. Reported by a peer running 0.1.0 against the mijntp codebase.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-04-12

Initial release.

### Added

- Rector rules for migrating Laravel validation to [sandermuller/laravel-fluent-validation](https://github.com/sandermuller/laravel-fluent-validation):
  - `ValidationStringToFluentRuleRector` — converts string-based rules (`'required|email|max:255'`) to the fluent API.
  - `ValidationArrayToFluentRuleRector` — converts array-based rules (`['required', 'email']`) to the fluent API.
  - `SimplifyFluentRuleRector` — collapses redundant or verbose fluent chains.
  - `GroupWildcardRulesToEachRector` — groups wildcard (`items.*`) rules into `FluentRule::each()` blocks.
  - `AddHasFluentRulesTraitRector` and `AddHasFluentValidationTraitRector` — adds the required traits to FormRequests, Livewire components, and custom validators.
- Set lists in `FluentValidationSetList` for applying rules individually or as a full migration pipeline.
- Covers `Validator::make()`, FormRequest `rules()`, Livewire `$rules` properties, and inline validator calls.
